This is the knowledge vault for Group 3's AD470 Practicum at [North Seattle College.](https://northseattle.edu/programs/application-development/application-development-bachelor-applied-science-bas-degree) We are using meteorological and topographical data collected from various sources to make projections on the likelihood of an [[notes/Avalanche|avalanche]] happening based on the given conditions.

# Concepts and Definitions
Here are links to helpful concepts for understanding snow science, avalanches, and the conditions that create them.
- [[notes/Avalanche|Avalanche]]
- [[notes/SNOTEL|SNOTEL]]

# üìä CSV Datasets
The compiled datasets that we have gathered for our data analysis models can be found in [[notes/CSV Datasets|the CSV Datasets page.]] 


# üêç Jupyter Notebooks
You can find rendered versions of the notebooks that we used for our data analysis models at [[notes/Jupyter Notebooks|the Jupyter Notebooks page.]]

# üíª Project Links
Here are some compiled links for our external project resources.

## Existing Capstone Project
We found the repo for [[notes/Drew Thayers Avalanche Prediction Capstone Project|Drew Thayers Avalanche Prediction Capstone Project]], which might be useful for seeing an existing example.
