This is the knowledge vault for Group 3's AD470 Practicum at [North Seattle College.](https://northseattle.edu/programs/application-development/application-development-bachelor-applied-science-bas-degree) We are using meterological and topographical data collected from various sources to make projections on the likelihood of an [[notes/Avalanche|avalanche]] happening based on the given conditions.
