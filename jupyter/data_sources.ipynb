    "# Suggested Data Sources\n",
    "For this project, I am suggesting we use the [Northwest Avalanche Center](https://nwac.us/)(NWAC) as our primary data source. This site is a hub for avalanche predictions and resources for the Cascade mountain range in Washington. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Avalanche Danger Predictions\n",
    "Daily avalanche danger predictions by zone can typically be found [here](https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/all/), though now that the winter season has ended archived reports can be found [here](https://nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/#/archive/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zones\n",
    "Because avalanche danger varies greatly by area, NWAC provides individual reports for different zones:\n",
    "- West Slopes North\n",
    "  - Mt Baker Ski Area\n",
    "- East Slopes North\n",
    "  - Loup Loup Ski Bowl\n",
    "- West Slopes Central\n",
    "- Stevens Pass\n",
    "  - Stevens Pass Ski Area\n",
    "- East Slopes Central\n",
    "  - Mission Ridge Ski Resort\n",
    "- Snoqualmie Pass\n",
    "  - Snoqualmie and Alpental Ski Areas\n",
    "- West Slopes South\n",
    "  - Crystal Mountain Ski Area (Alexi's home area)\n",
    "  - White Pass Ski Area\n",
    "- East Slopes South\n",
    "- Mt Hood\n",
    "  - Mt Hood Ski Area\n",
    "- Olympics\n",
    "  - Hurricane Ridge Ski Area\n",
    "  \n",
    "See [NWAC](https://nwac.us/) for a map. I figured we could use whatever individual zone anyone has interest in, or all of them. These avalanche predictions are not used by the ski areas listed above (they put out their own), but they're listed in case anyone has a particular area of interest. "

    "## How to Get Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select an area of interest\n",
    "    - Navigate to [NWAC Weather Data Map](https://nwac.us/weatherdata/map/#/)\n",
    "    - For this example, [Crystal Summit](https://nwac.us/weatherdata/map/#/29) was selected\n",
    "2. You can see seasonal weather data\n",
    "    - These data readings are taken every hour\n",
    "    - This data can be displayed in various time increments (past day, past week, past season)\n",
    "    - NWAC Weather Station Data:\n",
    "        - Temperature (Temp), F\n",
    "        - Relative Humidity (RF), %\n",
    "        - Wind Speed Minimum (Min), mph\n",
    "        - Wind Speed (Spd), mph\n",
    "        - Maximum Wind Speed (Gust), mph\n",
    "        - Wind Direction (Dir), deg (cardinal directions)\n",
    "    - Note that this is not formatted into CSV\n",
    "3. Select \"Custom Date\" > \"Season\" to get seasonal weather data\n",
    "    - Note that this data does not include all the information we will need (precipitation amounts)\n",
    "4. Format into CSV by importing as tab-separated into a spreadsheet software and downloading as CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does temperature matter?\n",
    "Very broadly speaking, lower temeratures mean higher avalanche danger. Snow that falls and sits at a constant 30 degrees homogenizes (sticks together) very quickly and results in less risk of a slide. This is a big part of why Washington generally has a much lower avalanche risk than Colorado.\n",
    "\n",
    "todo: story time??\n",
    "### Why does humidity matter?\n",
    "Not sure. Have to look into that one. todo\n",
    "### Why does wind speed matter?\n",
    "Prolonged high (25+ mph, todo: check #) winds produce an effect called \"wind loading\" where snow blows and is deposited in a different place. This results in \"blocks\" of snow on top that are prone to cracking/breaking and triggering avalanches. todo: more explanation and links\n",
    "#### Why do minimum and maximum matter?\n",
    "Also not sure. Will look into. todo"

    "[Snow Water Equivalent](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/snow-water-equivalent-swe-its-importance-northwest) (SWE) is a measure of how \"wet\" or \"dense\" snow is. It measures how much water is in the snow that fell. For example, 10\" of snow in Washington will likely have a much higher SWE than 10\" of snow in Colorado, because it is so much warmer and wetter. 1\" of rain can produce between 2\" of sleet and 50\" of dry, powdery snow depending on the air temperature. \n",
    "#### Why does SWE matter?\n",
    "This is a more accurate measure for snowfall than just height because it measures the actual density of the snow. I would much rather be caught in an avalanche with 10\" of snow with a lower SWE than 10\" of snow with a higher SWE because there would be less \"stuff\" carrying me downhill. \n",
